# BASH-scripts

In this repository, I store my case scenarios and BASH scripts to address them.  

## 📂 Repository Structure 

Each file contains:  
  - ✅ **Scenario description**
  - 📜 **BASH script**
  - ⚠️ **Errors encountered and their resolutions**  

This repository serves as a **learning resource** and a **proof of hands-on experience** with BASH.

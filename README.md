# BASH-scripts

In this repository, I store my case scenarios and BASH scripts to address them.  

## 📂 Repository Structure 

Each file contains:  
  - ✅ **Scenario description**
  - 📜 **BASH script**
  - ⚠️ **Errors encountered and their resolutions**  

This repository serves as a **learning resource** and a **proof of hands-on experience** with BASH.

# Scenarios:
## File name - check_urls_code
## Scenario: Check Response Codes of Links from a File

Objective: We have a file containing a list of URLs. Our task is to check the response codes for each link.

Requirements:
- If a link returns a status code greater than 400 and less than 599, indicating an unavailable response, stop further checks immediately.
- The entire process must complete within a time limit of 1 minute.
